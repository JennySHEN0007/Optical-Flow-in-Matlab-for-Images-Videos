# Optical-Flow-in-Matlab-for-Images-Videos

Two files of codes are in this repo using Optical Flow for tracking feature points in images/videos in Matlab.

``image_track.m`` tracks points in two images. However, it does not perform well, maybe because of the large-scale motion.

``video_track`` tracks points in a consecutive sequence of frames, it has a good performance.
